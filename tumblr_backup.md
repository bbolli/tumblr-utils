## 0. Description

`tumblr_backup.py` is a script that backs up your [Tumblr](http://tumblr.com)
blog locally.

The backup includes all images both from inline text as well as photo posts. An index links to
monthly pages, which contain all the posts from the respective month with links
to single post pages. Command line options select which posts to backup and set
the output format. The audio and video files can also be saved.

By default, all posts of a blog are backed up in minimally styled HTML5.

You can see an example of its output [on my home page](http://drbeat.li/tumblr).


## 1. Installation

1. Download and unzip
   [tumblr-utils.zip](https://github.com/bbolli/tumblr-utils/zipball/master)
   or clone the Github repo from `git://github.com/bbolli/tumblr-utils.git`.
2. Copy or symlink `tumblr_backup.py` to a directory on your `$PATH` like
   `~/bin` or `/usr/local/bin`.
3. Run `tumblr_backup.py` _blog-name_ as often as you like manually or from a
   cron job. The recommendation is to do a hourly incremental backup and a
   daily complete one.

There are two optional dependencies that enable additional features:

1. To backup audio and video, install [youtube-dl](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/).
2. To enable EXIF tagging, install [pyexiv2](http://tilloy.net/dev/pyexiv2/).

The fastest option to install these packages is via the package manager of
your operating system (apt-get, synaptic, yum, brew, etc). If this is not
feasible, download and install from the links above.

### Arguments

_blog-name_: The name of the blog to backup.

If your blog is under `.tumblr.com`, you can give just the first domain name
part; if your blog is under your own domain, give the whole domain name. You
can give more than one _blog-name_ to backup multiple blogs in one go.

The default blog name can be changed in the script.

### Environment variables

`LC_ALL`, `LC_TIME`, `LANG`: These variables, in decreasing importance,
determine the locale for month names and the date/time format.

### Exit code

The exit code is 0 if at least one post has been backed up, 1 if no post has
been backed up, 2 on invocation errors, or 3 if the backup was interrupted.


## 3. Operation

By default, `tumblr_backup` backs up all posts in HTML format.

The generated directory structure looks like this:

    ./ - the current directory
        <outdir>/ - your blog backup
            index.html - table of contents with links to the monthly pages
            backup.css - the default backup style sheet
            custom.css - the user's style sheet (optional)
            override.css - the user's style sheet override (optional)
            archive/
                <yyyy-mm-pnn>.html - the monthly pages
                …
            posts/
                <id>.html - the single post pages
                …
            media/
                <image.ext> - image files
                <audio>.mp3 - audio files
                <video>.mp4 - video files
                …
            json/
                <id>.json - the original JSON posts
                …
            theme/
                avatar.<ext> - the blog’s avatar
                style.css - the blog’s style sheet

The default `outdir` is the `blog-name`.

If option `-D` is used, one folder per post is generated, and the post's
images are saved in the same folder. The monthly archive is also stored in a
folder per month. This results in the same URL structure as on the Tumblr page.

The directories look like this:

    ./ - the current directory
        <outdir>/ - your blog backup
            index.html - table of contents with links to the monthly pages
            backup.css - the default backup style sheet
            custom.css - the user's style sheet (optional)
            override.css - the user's style sheet override (optional)
            archive/
                <yyyy-mm-pnn>/
                    index.html - the monthly page
                …
            posts/
                <id>/
                    index.html - the single post page
                    <image.ext> - the image file(s) for this post
                    <audio>.mp3 - audio files
                    <video>.mp4 - video files
                    …
                …
            json/
                <id>.json - the original JSON posts
                …
            theme/
                avatar.<ext> - the blog’s avatar
                style.css - the blog’s style sheet

The modification time of the single post pages is set to the post’s timestamp.
`tumblr_backup` applies a simple style to the saved pages. All generated pages
are [HTML5](http://html5.org).

The index pages are recreated from scratch after every backup, based on the
existing single post pages. Normally, the index and monthly pages are in
reverse chronological order, i.e. more recent entries on top. The options `-R`
and `-r` can be used to reverse the order.

If you want to use a custom CSS file, call it `custom.css`, put it in the
backup folder and do a complete backup. Without a custom CSS file,
`tumblr_backup` saves a default style sheet in `backup.css`. The blog's style
sheet itself is always saved in `theme/style.css`.

It you want to override just a few default styles, create the file
`override.css` in the backup folder. This file is included automatically by the
default style sheet. You may have to mark your overriding styles with
`!important` to make them stick because `override.css` is imported first in the
style sheet.

Tumblr saves some image files without extension. This probably saves a few
billion bytes in their database. `tumblr_backup` restores the image extensions.
If an image is already backed up, it is not downloaded again. If an image is
re-uploaded/edited, the old image is kept in the backup, but no post links to
it. The format of the image file names can be selected with the `-I` option.

It must be noted that saved inline images (from non-photo posts) keep their
name. This means that only the first image with any given name will be saved;
the others with the same name will point to the first one.

The download of images can be disabled with option `-k`. In this case, the
image URLs will point to the original location.

With option `-e`, IPTC keyword tags can be added to image files. There are
three possibilities:

1. `-e kw1,kw2` adds the post's tags plus `kw1` and `kw2` as keywords
2. `-e ''` adds just the post's tags
3. `-e -` removes all keywords from the image

In incremental backup mode, `tumblr_backup` saves only posts that have higher
ids than the highest id saved locally. Note that posts that are edited after
being backed up are not backed up again with this option.

In JSON backup mode, the original JSON source returned by the Tumblr API is saved
under the `json/` folder in addition to the HTML format.

Automatic archive mode `-a` is designed to be used from an hourly cron script.
It normally makes an incremental backup except if the current hour is the one
given as argument. In this case, `tumblr_backup` will make a full backup. An
example invocation is `tumblr_backup.py -qa4` to do a full backup at 4 in the
morning. This option obviates the need for shell script logic to determine what
options to pass.

In Blosxom format mode, the posts generated are saved in a format suitable for
re-publishing in [Blosxom](http://www.blosxom.com) with the [Meta
plugin](http://www.blosxom.com/plugins/meta/meta.htm). Images are not
downloaded; instead, the image links point back to the original image on
Tumblr. The posts are saved in the current folder with a `.txt` extension. The
index is not updated.

In order to limit the set of backed up posts, use the `-n` and `-s` options.
The most recent post is always number 0, so the option `-n 200` would select
the 200 most recent posts. Calling `tumblr_backup -n 100 -s 200` would skip the
200 most recent posts and backup the next 100. `-n 1` is the fastest way to
rebuild the index pages.

The option `-T` limits the backup to posts of the given type. `-t` saves only
posts with the given tags. `-Q` combines both: it accepts comma-separated
requests of the form `TYPE:TAG1:TAG2:…`, where the tags for each post type can
be different. Omitting the TAGs is allowed; this saves posts of this type with
any or no tags. Example: `-Q any:personal,quote,photo:me:self` saves all posts
tagged 'personal', all quotes, and photos tagged 'me' or 'self' or 'personal'
(because of the `any` request).

The option `--no-reblog` suppresses the backup of reposts of other blogs'
posts.

If you combine `-n`, `-s`, `-i`, `-p`, `-t`, `-T`, `-Q` and `--no-reblog`, only
posts matching all criteria will be backed up.

All options use only public Tumblr APIs, so you can use the program to backup
blogs that you don’t own.

`tumblr_backup` is developed and tested on Linux and OS X. If you want to run
it under Windows, I suggest to try the excellent [Cygwin](http://cygwin.com)
environment.
