#Tumblr Backup 101

This guide is for 100% programming/coding newbies to use this Tumblr Backup service.

##Why 101?
Tumblr does not have an export service, and all the easily downloadable/online ones are not very good. This program is excellent and easy to use - but also a but intimidating if you have never used command line programmes before.

Don't panic! I'm going to walk you through step by step.

##Getting Started
This guide is for Windows users. 

###Step 1: Install Python
1. The program we are going to run is called tumblr_backup.py. It is a **python file**. This means it is a file written in the programming language Python.

2. Just like you need a program like Word to view a_document.doc, or Paint to view a_picture.jpeg, you need to download Python to make this program work.

3. Go to the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2712/). We are downloading v.2 of Python because this program is designed to work with v2

4. Download the file called **Windows x86 MSI installer**

5. Install it by double clicking.

6. You've installed Python! You can now run Python programs, and if you want to learn to code, you can also use this installation to practice your coding.
